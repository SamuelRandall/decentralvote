Decentralized voting on Ethereum

## Why decentralized voting?

People should have control over their vote and have faith in any given election. This tenet of freedom is at the heart of democracy, and our most advanced technologies should empower us to have more free and fair elections.

A public blockchain, uncensored and uncontrolled by a central authority, is such a technology.

This platform intends to demonstrate a path towards better elections for voters worldwide.
